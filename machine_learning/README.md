# Machine learning for noise reduction
This part of the Drifttube software package contains code and data that is meant for experimenting, if machine learning techniques can be utilized to identify data from noise in FADC read events.

## Requirements
The machine learning (ML) algorithms are not self-developed, here I use the python-library "scikit-learn"
