# Drifttube
A software for analyzing signals of a drift tube detector for charged particles. It then calculates, stores and plots things like the drift time spectrum, the rt-relation, efficiency and afterhit-probablity.
Its electronic signals are first amplified in any way and then recorded by a FADC or any other digitization device. The digitization needs to be converted to a binary file format, this software can read as input. The documentation for this binary file can be found at the wiki for this project.
